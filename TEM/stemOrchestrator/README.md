Why do we need STEM-Orchestrator?
- The various hardware components[eels detector, in-situ-holders, aberration corrector etc] of a STEM system often operate in isolation and lack seamless communication.
-  STEM-Orchestrator bridges this gap, enabling synchronized control and data sharing across devicesâ€”crucial for deploying complex machine learning workflows at the atomic scale and accelerating materials characterization.

## Known issues - trouble-shooting:
### 1. Not seeing logging in action? 

- Chect if logger is set before importing utilities

 ```python
 # 1st set the logger
from stemOrchestrator.logging_config   import setup_logging
data_folder  = "."
out_path = data_folder
setup_logging(out_path=out_path) 

#Then import the utilities
from stemOrchestrator.acquisition import TFacquisition, DMacquisition

 ```
