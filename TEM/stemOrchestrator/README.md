Why do we need STEM-Orchestrator?
- The various hardware components[eels detector, in-situ-holders, aberration corrector etc] of a STEM system often operate in isolation and lack seamless communication.
-  STEM-Orchestrator bridges this gap, enabling synchronized control and data sharing across devicesâ€”crucial for deploying complex machine learning workflows at the atomic scale and accelerating materials characterization.
