# Contributions are very welcome:
    - handling issue
    - opening discussion
    - making notebooks
    - writing docs
 
## General thumb rules if adding/editing the source code:
    - either write a new test or modify an existing one related to the feature added
    - Make sure logging is done when a function executes and just when it return: makes life easy for debugging on hardware side
    - edit/add contribution credit will be given appropriately
